## About

This project is a re-creation of the card game [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)). The goal of the game is to match up each card with another that has the same rank. This is done by choosing two face-down cards and flipping them to see if they match, staying face-up if they do. This must be done in as few turns as possible.
